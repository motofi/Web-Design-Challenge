<!-- Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
For this homework we'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations
we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting weather data.
In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by
which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their
corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a
comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

Website Requirements
For reference, see the "Screenshots" section below.
The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

A landing page containing:

An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page.


Four visualization pages, each with:

A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


A "Comparisons" page that:

Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on
extra-small and small screens.




A "Data" page that:

Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The table must be a bootstrap table component. Hint

The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML.
Try using a tool you already know, pandas. Pandas has a nifty method approprately called
to_html that allows you to generate a HTML table from a pandas dataframe. See the documentation here






The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links
to each individual visualization page.
Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page,
and "Data" which links to the data page.
Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots
"Navigation Menu" section (notice the background color change).

Finally, the website must be deployed to GitHub pages.
When finished, submit to BootcampSpot the links to 1) the deployed app and 2) the GitHub repository.

Considerations

You may use the weather data or choose another dataset. Alternatively, you may use the
included cities dataset and pull the images from the assets folder.
You must use bootstrap. This includes using the bootstrap navbar component for the header on
every page, the bootstrap table component for the data page, and the bootstrap grid for
responsiveness on the comparison page.
You must deploy your website to GitHub pages, with the website working on a live, publicly
accessible URL as a result.
Be sure to use a CSS media query for the navigation menu.
Be sure your website works at all window widths/sizes.
Feel free to take some liberty in the visual aspects, but keep the core functionality the same.
